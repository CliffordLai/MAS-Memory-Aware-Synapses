# MAS
A pytorch implementation of Memory Aware Synapses: Learning what not to forget method. It allows a neural network to learn in a continual manner without catastrophic forgetting. Moreover, at deployment time while the system is applied to a set of images, the method learns the important parts of the tasks that shouldn't be forgotten allowing extra freedom for later tasks.

The code contains a demo file that shows a learning scenario in mnist split set of tasks.
